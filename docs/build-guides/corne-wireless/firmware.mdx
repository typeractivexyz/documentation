# Firmware

If you're not familiar, ZMK is a wireless-focused firmware, and it powers our Corne Wireless.

If you want to get running quickly, you can use our default firmware files. These are pre-compiled but are not guaranteed to have the most up-to-date version of ZMK. Check how to install these files in the ["Installing Firmware"](#installing-firmware) section at the bottom of this page

## Keymap Customization with ZMK Studio

ZMK Studio provides runtime update functionality to ZMK powered devices, allowing users to change their keymap layers without flashing new firmware to their keyboards.

The firmware files provided above are compatible with ZMK Studio. You can use the firmware files to flash your Corne Wireless and then use ZMK Studio to customize your keymap.

You can use ZMK Studio with Chrome/Edge at https://zmk.studio/. The web app does not support updating via BLE, but the native app does.

To use the native app for Linux, macOS, or Windows, download the appropriate file from the [latest release](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk-studio/releases).

## Building Your Own Firmware

With the nature of a small keyboard like the Corne, you're likely interested in making a custom keymap for it.

We've created ZMK config repositories for the Corne Wireless for you to use as a template for yourself. If you'd like to set it up manually, follow the [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup).

### Repos
| Columns | üö´ nice!view | ‚úÖ nice!view |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
|6|[Repository](https://github.com/typeractivexyz/corne-wireless-zmk-config)|[Repository](https://github.com/typeractivexyz/corne-wireless-view-zmk-config)|
|5|[Repository](https://github.com/typeractivexyz/corne-wireless-5-col-zmk-config)|[Repository](https://github.com/typeractivexyz/corne-wireless-5-col-view-zmk-config)|

After using the template in the top right corner, your firmware will now be built by GitHub Actions.

Now you can edit the `corne.keymap` file to your liking. You can find this file in the `config` folder. For documentation on customizing your keymap, check out the [ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/keymaps). **Alternatively, use the [visual online keymap editor by Nick Coutsos](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor), which makes things really easy!**

After adjusting the keymap and saving your changes in GitHub, a new firmware file will be built. You can find the firmware files in the `Actions` tab. Click the latest workflow and then click the `firmware` artifact under the `Artifacts` section at the bottom. A zip file with the firmware will be downloaded.

Now you can update your nice!nano with the new firmware.

## Installing Firmware

Installing firmware on the nice!nano is easy.

1. Plug in your nice!nano to your computer.
2. Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button. <br/> <small>(You can skip this if you haven't flashed the nice!nano before)</small>
3. Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the `NICENANO` drive or copy it with your terminal.
4. After flashing is complete, the drive will disappear and the nice!nano will reboot. <br/> <small>Your computer may report an error when transferring the file, you can likely ignore this.[^1]</small> 
5. If you haven't yet, you can turn the power switch **on** by pushing it up on the side of the keyboard.

[^1]: There is a known issue with transferring using Finder on macOS version 13.0. Upgrade to 13.1 to fix this issue.

## Congratulations!

You've successfully finished building your Wireless Corne keyboard! üéâ
