# nice!nano

Installing your nice!nano is usually the first step in building your keyboard. In this guide, we'll go over the three different ways to install your nice!nano.

## Video Tutorial (EZ-Solder Hotswap)

## Select the method you're using:

  <TabItem value="no-solder" label="No-Solder Hotswap">
```
:::info
The headers inside the nice!nano's ESD bag are **not** your no-solder headers. The no-solder headers will be in a separate bag in your kit. They look like [this](https://typeractive.xyz/products/no-solder-spring-headers).

  <TabItem value="square-post" label="Included Headers" >
```
:::caution
We highly recommend using one of the other hotswap methods. Being able to remove your nice!nano helps with troubleshooting and makes it easier to replace if it breaks. 

If you're using the included headers, you'll need to install your battery **before** soldering your nice!nano.

## Soldering to the PCB

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="solder-method">
  <TabItem value="ez-solder" label="EZ-Solder Hotswap" default>
```
  1. Take your sockets (the part with the holes) and insert them into the top of the PCB (the side with the JST, power switch, and reset button)
  2. Optionally tape down the sockets to the PCB
  3. Flip the PCB over and solder the top and bottom pins and ensure the socket is flush and straight with the PCB
  4. Take off the optional tape
  5. Solder the rest of the pins
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="no-solder" label="No-Solder Hotswap">
```
Since these are ***no***-solder headers, you won't need to solder anything. Just follow the steps below to install your header to the PCB.
  1. Take your headers and insert them into the top of the PCB (the side with the JST, power switch, and reset button)
  2. Use the plastic part of the header to push the pins into the PCB. The plastic should be flush with the PCB when fully inserted
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mill-max-solder" label="Mill-Max Hotswap">
```

  1. Take your headers and insert them into the top of the PCB (the side with the JST, power switch, and reset button)
  2. You'll likely want to put the short side of the header into the PCB
  4. Flip the PCB over and solder the headers
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Insert Pins and Headers

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="solder-method">
  <TabItem value="ez-solder" label="EZ-Solder Hotswap" default>
```
  1. Insert your headers into the sockets. Push down on the plastic part so you don't poke yourself!
  2. Ensure the headers are flush against the sockets
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="no-solder" label="No-Solder Hotswap">
```
There are no pins to insert with the no-solder headers. Jump over to the [battery guide](./batteries) to install your battery, and then come back here to install your nice!nano.
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mill-max-solder" label="Mill-Max Hotswap">
```
  1. If you purchased painter's tape, place a strip over the top of each socket. This prevents solder from fusing the sockets and pins later.
  2. Poke your pins through the tape (if there is any) and into the sockets
  3. Getting the pins into the sockets requires a bit of force. I recommend using a small flat item to push the pins in. The back side of a pair of tweezers usually works well.
  4. Ensure the pins are completely inserted. They sit about 2mm above the top of the socket when fully inserted.
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="square-post" label="Included Headers" >
```
  1. There's no pins or headers to solder in this step with the included headers.
  2. You'll likely want to seat the battery in the PCB right now

```

## Solder the nice!nano

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="solder-method">
  <TabItem value="ez-solder" label="EZ-Solder Hotswap" default>
```
  1. Place the nice!nano **face down**[^1] on the headers.
  2. The pins should be slightly peeking out. 
  3. Ensure that the top left and top right pins (B+/B-) do not have pins in them. Only the bottom 12 on each column should have them.
  4. Solder each corner pin while making sure the nice!nano is flush against the socket.
  5. Solder the rest of the pins.
  
You'll now want to slowly pry the nice!nano out of the sockets to continue the build.

Try to pull the nice!nano straight up if possible to avoid bent pins when pulling it out. Alternatively, take a blunt, thin object and *very* slowly pry the nice!nano from either side until it is removed. In the end, a sudden jolt will happen when the nano comes out. The less, more controlled force will help avoid bent pins.
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="no-solder" label="No-Solder Hotswap">
```

  2. Ensure that the top left and top right pins (B+/B-) do not have pins in them. Only the bottom 12 on each column should have them
  3. Push the nice!nano firmly down into the headers. The pins should be slightly peeking out
  4. That's it! Your nice!nano is now installed without any soldering
```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mill-max-solder" label="Mill-Max Hotswap">

  1. Make sure your battery is installed! You can follow the [battery guide here](./batteries).
  2. Place the nice!nano **face down**[^1] on the headers.
  3. Make sure the nice!nano isn't putting excessive force on the battery.
  4. Solder each corner pin while making sure the nice!nano is flush against the battery.
  5. Solder the rest of the pins.

## Wrap Up

Now that the nice!nano is installed, you can continue to the next step of installing the nice!view or batteries if you don't have any nice!views.
