# Getting Started

Our Corne Wireless is made to make the perfect wireless keyboard. We made the following major changes to the Corne:

 - Power Switch: Turn off your board when traveling or when not in use
 - JST Jack: Easily and safely install your batteries
 - nice!view Support: Install your nice!view directly without a bodge wire
 - Partially Assembled: No need to solder the hotswap sockets, diodes, reset button, power switch, or JST jack
 - Choc PCB: Our Choc PCB is using Choc spacing, which makes it more compact than usual

You can customize your wireless in 3D Corne at the [keyboard customizer](https://typeractive.xyz/pages/build).

## Build Videos

Each of the steps on the following pages has a short video tutorial, or you can watch one of the two full build videos below.

There's a concise video made by Joe Scotto that goes over the entire build process. It's a great resource if you're looking for a quick overview of the build process.

If you would like a longer form video with extra commentary, we have a build stream as well.
